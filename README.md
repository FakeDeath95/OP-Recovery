Moving the delay below 0.2 seconds won't do you any good, the speed you get money will stay the same, as your speed is capped by how fast Rockstar can handle the transactions

Don't spam transactions manually

Use responsibly, and use at your own risk!

Uses original OP Recovery v2.1 from @gaymer  on Modest version

----------------------------
Differences between Yim and Modest version

Yim:
Loop actually stops and begins without bug

Can change speed of the loop easily (Capped)

Doesn't need game restart to stop loop



Modest:
Loop is buggy and can't be stopped (Menu problem, not script problem)

Speed is fixed, requires going into the code to change

May require game restart to stop loop


Now you brokies can get rich and use the same script on both menus
